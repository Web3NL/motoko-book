# Objects and Classes

When we looked at [records](/common-programming-concepts/types/records.html) we saw that we could package named variables and their values inside curly braces, like `{ x = 0 }`. The type of such a record was of the form `{ x : Nat }`.

In this chapter, we will look at _objects_, which are like an advanced version of records. We will also look at _classes_, which are like 'factories' or 'constructors' for manufacturing objects.
