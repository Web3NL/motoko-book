# Comments

A one-line comment is written by starting the line with `//`.
```motoko
// This is a comment
```

It's always recommended to clarify your code by commenting:
```motoko
// A constant representing my phone number
let phoneNumber = 1234567890;
```    

A comment could start at the end of a line:
```motoko
var weight = 80; // In kilo grams!
```

And comments could span multiple lines by enclosing it in `/** **/`:

```motoko
/**
Multiline comment
A description of the code goes here
**/
```
