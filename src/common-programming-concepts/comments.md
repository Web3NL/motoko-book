# Comments

A one-line comment is written by starting the line with `//`.
```motoko
{{#include _mo/comments.mo:a}}
```

It's always recommended to clarify your code by commenting:
```motoko
{{#include _mo/comments.mo:b}}
```    

A comment could start at the end of a line:
```motoko
{{#include _mo/comments.mo:c}}
```

And comments could span multiple lines by enclosing it in `/** **/`:

```motoko
{{#include _mo/comments.mo:d}}
```
