# Comments

A one-line comment is written by starting the line with `//`.
```motoko
// This is a comment
```

It's always recommended to clarify your code by commenting:
```motoko
// A constant representing my phone number
let phoneNumber = 1234567890;
```    

A comment could start at the end of a line
```motoko
var weight = 80; // In kilo grams!
```
