# Control Flow

Control flow refers to the order in which a program is _executed_. We discuss three common _control flow_ constructs in Motoko: `if` expressions, `if else` expressions and `switch` expressions.

These constructs are called _expressions_ because they _evaluate_ to a value of a certain type.
