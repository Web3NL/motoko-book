# Control Flow

Control flow refers to the order in which a program is *executed*. We discuss three common *control flow* constructs in Motoko: `if` expressions, `if else` expressions and `switch` expressions.

These constructs are called *expressions* because they *evaluate* to a value of a certain type.
