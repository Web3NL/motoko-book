# Control Flow

Control flow refers to the order in which a program is *executed*. We discuss four common *control flow* constructs in Motoko: `if` expressions, `if else` expressions, `switch` expressions and (optionally labeled) `loops`. 

These constructs are called *expressions* because they *evaluate* to a value of a certain type.
