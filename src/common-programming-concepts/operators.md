# Operators
Operators are symbols that indicate several kinds of *operations* on values. They consist of one, two or three characters and are used to perform manipulations on typically one or two values at a time.

```motoko, run
{{#include _mo/operators.mo:a}} 
```

The `+` character in the example above serves as an addition operator, which performs an [*arithmetic operation*](/common-programming-concepts/operators/numeric-operators.html). 

In this chapter we will cover several kinds of operators, namely [*numeric*](/common-programming-concepts/operators/numeric-operators.html), [*relational*](/common-programming-concepts/operators/relational-operators.html), [*bitwise*](/common-programming-concepts/operators/bitwise-operators.html), and [*assignment*](/common-programming-concepts/operators/assignment-operators.html) operators. We will also cover [*text concatenation*](/common-programming-concepts/operators/text-concatenation.html), [*logical expressions*](/common-programming-concepts/operators/logical-expressions.html) and [*operator precedence*](/common-programming-concepts/operators/operator-precedence.html).
