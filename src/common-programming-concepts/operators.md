# Operators
Operators are symbols that indicate several kinds of *operations* on values. They consist of one, two or three characters and are used to perform manipulations on typically one or two values at a time.

```motoko
{{#include _mo/operators.mo:a}} 
```

The `+` character in the example above serves as an addition operator, which performs an *arithmetic operation*. 

In this chapter we will cover several kinds of operators, namely `numeric`, `relational` and `assignment` operators.
