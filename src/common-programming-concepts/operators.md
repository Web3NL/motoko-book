# Operators

Operators are symbols that indicate several kinds of _operations_ on values. They consist of one, two or three characters and are used to perform manipulations on typically one or two values at a time.

```motoko, run
{{#include _mo/operators.mo:a}}
```

The `+` character in the example above serves as an addition operator, which performs an [_arithmetic operation_](/common-programming-concepts/operators/numeric-operators.html).

In this chapter we will cover several kinds of operators, namely [_numeric_](/common-programming-concepts/operators/numeric-operators.html), [_relational_](/common-programming-concepts/operators/relational-operators.html), [_bitwise_](/common-programming-concepts/operators/bitwise-operators.html), and [_assignment_](/common-programming-concepts/operators/assignment-operators.html) operators. We will also cover [_text concatenation_](/common-programming-concepts/operators/text-concatenation.html), [_logical expressions_](/common-programming-concepts/operators/logical-expressions.html) and [_operator precedence_](/common-programming-concepts/operators/operator-precedence.html).
