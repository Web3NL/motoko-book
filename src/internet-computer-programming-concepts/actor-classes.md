# Actor Classes
Just like [classes](/common-programming-concepts/objects-and-classes/classes.html) are 'constructors' for [objects](/common-programming-concepts/objects-and-classes/objects.html), *actor classes* are like 'constructors' for [actors](/internet-computer-programming-concepts/actors.html). They are declared with the `actor class` keywords in their own separate Motoko source file:
```motoko
{{#include _mo/actor-class.mo:a}}
```

TBD
