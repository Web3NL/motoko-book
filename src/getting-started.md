# Getting Started

[Motoko Playground](http://localhost:3000/getting-started/motoko-playground.html) is the easiest way to deploy a *Hello World* example in Motoko. 

Another way is to [install](http://localhost:3000/getting-started/installation.html) the [DFINITY Canister Software Development Kit](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk) and set up a local development environment.
