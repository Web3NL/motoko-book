# Primitive Types
As described [earlier](/common-programming-concepts/types.html) in this book, [*primitive types*](/common-programming-concepts/types.html#primitive-types) are core data types that are not *composed* of more fundamental types. 

Primitive types do **not** need to be imported before they can be used in [*type annotation*](/common-programming-concepts/types.html). But the Base Library does have *[modules](/common-programming-concepts/modules.html)* for each primitive type to perform common tasks, like *converting* between the data types, *transforming* the data types, *comparing* the data types and other functionality.  

In this chapter we visit some of the functionality provided by the Base Library modules for several primitive data types.
