# Primitive Types

As described [earlier](/common-programming-concepts/types.html) in this book, [_primitive types_](/common-programming-concepts/types.html#primitive-types) are core data types that are not _composed_ of more fundamental types.

Primitive types do **not** need to be imported before they can be used in [_type annotation_](/common-programming-concepts/types.html). But the Base Library does have _[modules](/common-programming-concepts/modules.html)_ for each primitive type to perform common tasks, like _converting_ between the data types, _transforming_ the data types, _comparing_ the data types and other functionality.

In this chapter we visit some of the functionality provided by the Base Library modules for several primitive data types.
