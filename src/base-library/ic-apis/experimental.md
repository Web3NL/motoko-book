# Experimental Motoko Modules

We reference these modules for completeness, but will not cover them in depth.

> **NOTE**  
> _These system APIs are experimental and may change in the future._

## ExperimentalCycles

This module allows for working with cycles during canister calls.

See the [official docs](https://internetcomputer.org/capabilities/reverse-gas) and the [Base Library Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/base/ExperimentalCycles) for more information.

## ExperimentalInternetComputer

This module exposes low-level system functions for calling other canisters and instruction counting.

See the [Base Library Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/base/ExperimentalInternetComputer) for more information.

## ExperimentalStableMemory

This module exposes low-level system functions for working with stable memory.

See [Stable Storage](/advanced-concepts/scalability/stable-storage.html) and the [Base Library Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/base/ExperimentalStableMemory) for more information.
