# Bounded Number Types
The Nat8 type represents 8-bit unsigned integers with checked arithmetic, which means that operations performed on Nat8 values are checked to prevent integer overflow or underflow. 

Similarly, Nat16 represents 16-bit unsigned integers, 

Nat32 represents 32-bit unsigned integers, and Nat64 represents 64-bit unsigned integers. 

All these types have checked arithmetic, making them safer to use than the corresponding signed integer types.
