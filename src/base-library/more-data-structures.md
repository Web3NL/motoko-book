# More Data Structures

Besides the more [common data structures](/base-library/data-structures.html), the Motoko Base Library also includes other useful data structures.

We will not cover them in this book, but we include them as a reference to the [official docs](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/base/).

## AssocList

The [`AssocList`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/base/AssocList) module provides a [linked-list](/base-library/data-structures/list.html) of key-value pairs of generic type `(K, V)`

## Deque

The [`Deque`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/base/Deque) module provides a double-ended queue of a generic element type `T`.

## Stack

The [`Stack`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/base/Stack) module provides a class `Stack<X>` for a minimal _Last In, First Out_ stack of elements of type `X`.
