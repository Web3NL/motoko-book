# Project Deployment

While [Motoko Playground](/internet-computer-programming-concepts/actors/actor-to-canister.html#motoko-playground) is very convenient for trying out small snippets of Motoko code, developing canisters requires a development environment with more features.

In this chapter we will look at:

- [Installing](/project-deployment/installing-sdk.html) the SDK
- [Compile Motoko](/project-deployment/local-deployment.html) code into WASM modules
- [Configure](/project-deployment/local-deployment.html) and deploy canisters locally
- Managing [identities](/project-deployment/pem-files.html)
- Setup a [cycles wallet](/project-deployment/cycles-wallet.html)
- Deploy to [mainnet](/project-deployment/ic-deployment.html)

## `dfx` commands

In this chapter we only cover the most essential commands in `dfx`. For a full overview of `dfx` commands, see the [official docs](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/cli-reference/).

Remember that all `dfx` commands and subcommands allow us to add the `--help` flag to print out useful information about the use of the command.
