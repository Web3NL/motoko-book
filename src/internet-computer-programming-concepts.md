# Internet Computer Programming Concepts

This chapters covers Internet Computer specific features of Motoko. Before diving in, lets visit four concepts that look alike, but are not the same!

- [**Actor**](/internet-computer-programming-concepts/actors.html) An abstract notion of a self-contained software execution unit that communicates with other actors through asynchronous message passing.

- [**Canister**](/internet-computer-programming-concepts/canisters.html) An instance of an actor that runs on the Internet Computer Blockchain.

- **WebAssembly Module** A file containing a binary representation of a program (that may have been written in Motoko) that is installed in a canister that runs on the Internet Computer. 

- **Smart Contract**  The traditional notion of a blockchain program with roughly the same security guarantees as canisters but with limited memory and computation power.
