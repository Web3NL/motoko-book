# Pre-upgrade and Post-upgrade

For a demonstration of the use of the `preupgrade` and `postupgrade` system functions, see the [tokenized comments example](/tokenized-comments-example.html).

> **NOTE**  
> _`preupgrade` and `postupgrade` system functions may trap during execution and data may be lost in the process. Work is underway to improve canister upgrades by working with [stable storage](/advanced-concepts/scalability/stable-storage.html)._
