# Advanced Concepts

This chapter covers _advanced concepts_ in Motoko and the Internet Computer (IC). After this chapter you will have enough knowledge to build fully on-chain Web3 applications!

## Motoko and the Internet Computer

Motoko is a programming language that is designed to write _advanced smart contracts_ on the IC. As a programmer, you don't need to understand the deeper details of how the IC blockchain functions. But since Motoko code is written for the IC, it is important for an advanced programmer to be familiar with some concepts of the IC.

Actors written in Motoko have direct access to [_system functionality_](/advanced-concepts/system-apis.html) on the IC. We have already seen dedicated syntax for IC features, like [stable variables](/internet-computer-programming-concepts/basic-memory-persistence/stable-variables.html) and [caller authentication](/internet-computer-programming-concepts/principals-and-authentication.html#caller-authenticating-public-shared-functions).

In this chapter we will dive deeper into Motoko and the features that allow us to utilize many important features of the IC.
