# Advanced Concepts
This chapter covers *advanced concepts* in Motoko and the Internet Computer (IC). After this chapter you will have enough knowledge to build fully on-chain Web3 applications! 

## Motoko and the Internet Computer
Motoko is a programming language that is designed to write *advanced smart contracts* on the IC. As a programmer, you don't need to understand the deeper details of how the IC blockchain functions. But since Motoko code is written for the IC, it is important for an advanced programmer to be familiar with some concepts of the IC.

Actors written in Motoko have direct access to *system functionality* on the IC. We have already seen dedicated syntax for IC features, like stable variables and caller authentication.

In this chapter we will dive deeper into Motoko and the features that allow us to utilize many important features of the IC.
